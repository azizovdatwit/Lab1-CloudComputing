Note: there is test2.py file where I used google smtp server to send an email to myself. 
If you'd like to run this you need to generate an App password for your google account and use that as login parameters.
To generate an app password, follow the instructions on here:  https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en
Side note, You can't generate unless you has 2FA enabled. The name of the app on Gmail itself doesn't really matter, 
you only need the password so that you can pass it into server.login.Â
